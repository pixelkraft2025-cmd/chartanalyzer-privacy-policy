    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: January 05, 2026</strong></p>

    <p>PixelKraft ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our application, <strong>Chart Analyzer</strong>, collects, uses, and safeguards your information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>A. Personal Information</h3>
    <p>When you create an account, we may collect authentication information via <strong>Firebase Authentication</strong>. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>User ID (generated by our system)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Device and Usage Data</h3>
    <p>We may collect information about your mobile device and internet connection, including the device's unique device identifier, operating system, and mobile network information.</p>

    <h3>C. Image Data</h3>
    <p>Our app requires access to your device's <strong>Camera</strong> and <strong>Photo Gallery</strong> to function. You upload images of charts for analysis. These images are processed to provide technical analysis but are not permanently stored on our servers unless explicitly saved by you (e.g., in a history feature) or required for the immediate processing by our AI providers.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authenticate users:</strong> To manage your account and login sessions securely.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide AI Analysis:</strong> We send the chart images you upload to <strong>Google Firebase Vertex AI</strong> to generate technical analysis, pattern recognition, and trading insights.</li>
        <li><strong>Improve our services:</strong> To monitor app stability and fix bugs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. Below are the links to the privacy policies of the third-party service providers used by the app:</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. You have the right to request the deletion of your account and associated data directly within the app via the "Profile" screen.</p>
    <p>Once you delete your account, your credentials and User ID are removed from our authentication system permanently.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. All data transmission between the app and our AI services is encrypted via HTTPS/TLS.</p>
